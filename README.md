# Thermal-Sensitivity: noSolar branch (built off of experimenting branch)
1) Removed Solar as a landscape EV: resulted in **no** direction mismatches in **9 best** models.
2) Ran experimentation script to find **9 best** models using VIFs **20, 15, 10, 5** w/ correlation cut-offs **0.8, 0.7, 0.6**: **results/2021/MLR/comparisonResults/model_comparison_results.csv.**
   * **All** 9 models had **0** direction mismatches:
   * **Increased** adjusted R squared as a whole.
   * **Increased** % of significant EVs/included EVs.
