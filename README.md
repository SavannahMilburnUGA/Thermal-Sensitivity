# Thermal-Sensitivity
* Analyze the relationship between air temperature & stream temperature (thermal sensitivity - slope) using time-series data in CRB. <br>
* Analyze spatial variation of thermal sensitivity. <br>
* How do landscape variables explain the spatial variation of thermal sensitivity. <br>
# Current tasks
1) Join existing data present in CRB data folders for 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024. <br>
2) Find common periods by analyzing data for month & year.
   1) Thermal sensitivity early summer vs. late summer (depends on data)
   2) May just use 1-2 months for all stations (depends on data)
3) Get max & thermal sensitivity values (static -> can see data availability for landscape variables after). <br>
